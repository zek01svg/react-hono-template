## Navigating the Docs

### Architecture & Concepts

If you want to understand how the system is structured, how client and server communicate, or how dynamic environment variables work:

- [**Architecture Guide**](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - System Component Overview (Mermaid Diagram)
  - Runtime Environment Variable Injection (`/api/runtime.js`)
  - Frontend & Backend Technology Stack Breakdown
  - Database Architecture & Authentication Flow
  - Telemetry & Logging (Logtape + Sentry)

### Development & Contribution

If you are setting up your local environment, adding new features, or submitting a pull request:

- [**Contributing Guide**](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - Local Environment Prerequisites & Setup (`bun dev`)
  - Infrastructure with Docker Compose (Postgres, Maildev, MinIO)
  - Code Quality Standards (Oxlint, Oxfmt, Lefthook git hooks)
  - Database Migrations (`drizzle-kit`) & Seeding (`scripts/db-seed.ts`)
  - Testing Strategy (Vitest unit tests & Playwright E2E tests)

### Production & Deployment

If you are deploying the application to staging or production using Docker:

- [**Deployment Guide**](./DEPLOYMENT.md)
  - Multi-stage Docker Build Pipeline (`Dockerfile`)
  - Runtime Environment Variable Configuration
  - Static Asset Serving & Health Check Endpoints
  - Docker Compose Service Definitions

### API Reference & Standards

If you are developing backend endpoints or integrating frontend components with server routes:

- [**API Documentation**](./API.md)
  - Hono Router Structure & Path Alias Imports (`#server/*`, `#client/*`, `#shared/*`)
  - Interactive API Reference (`/api/scalar`) & OpenAPI Specs (`/api/openapi`)
  - Authentication Endpoints (`/api/auth/*`)
  - Standardized Error Formats & Validation Handling
